This code implements a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game in C++. Here's a summary and explanation of the code:

1. **Header Inclusion**: The code includes the `<iostream>` header, which is required for input and output operations.

2. **Global Constants and Variables**:
   - `SIZE`: Defines the size of the Tic-Tac-Toe board. In this case, it's set to 3, making it a 3x3 board.
   - `board`: 2D array representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board.

3. **Function Declarations**:
   - `initializeBoard()`: Initializes the board with empty spaces (' ') at the start of the game.
   - Other functions like `drawBoard()`, `getPlayerMove()`, `isMoveValid()`, `checkWin()`, and `isBoardFull()` are mentioned but not implemented in the provided code.

4. **Main Function**:
   - `main()`: This is where the game logic is implemented.
   - `initializeBoard()`: Calls the function to initialize the board.
   - `currentPlayer`: Variable to keep track of the current player ('X' or 'O').
   - The game loop runs indefinitely (`while (true)`) until there is a winner or a draw.

5. **Game Loop**:
   - `drawBoard()`: Function to draw the current state of the board.
   - `getPlayerMove()`: Function to get the player's move (row and column).
   - `isMoveValid()`: Checks if the player's move is valid.
   - If the move is not valid, the player is prompted to try again.
   - If the move is valid, the player's symbol ('X' or 'O') is placed on the board at the specified position.
   - `checkWin()`: Checks if there is a winner after each move.
   - `isBoardFull()`: Checks if the board is full, resulting in a draw if true.

6. **End of Game**:
   - If a player wins (`checkWin()` returns true), the board is redrawn, and the winner is announced.
   - If the game ends in a draw (`isBoardFull()` returns true), the board is redrawn, and it's announced as a draw.
   - The game loop breaks after either of these conditions, ending the game.

7. **Next Steps**:
   - The code mentions implementing functions like `drawBoard()`, `getPlayerMove()`, etc., which are essential for the game to function properly. These functions need to be implemented to complete the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
   - Additionally, the code comments hint at implementing a simple AI or random move for the computer player to make the game fully functional for single-player mode.

Overall, this code sets up the framework for a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, but the actual game logic and user interactions are yet to be implemented.
